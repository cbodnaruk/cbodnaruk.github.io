            There is something a little arcane about the idea of “research”, especially in the humanities or social sciences. What does it actually entail? What is the day to day of “research”. Due to various reasons (please give me a postdoc), I have a fair bit of time at the moment for research, and for some extra side projects, so I thought it could be interesting to write a bit of a blog about my own research and the process of doing it (because, of course, the one thing the world needs right now is more blogging). In particular, it might be interesting to people who are interested in linguistics, but also it’ll help me get my own thoughts more in order and keep track of everything I’ve actually done. I see research as sort of detective work, especially with my current interest in historical linguistics and what it can tell us about wider history and especially prehistory. I find little mysteries in my data, and I need to get to the bottom of them. Or, at the very least, I try to, and either get stuck or distracted and never really come to a satisfying conclusion. It’s very frustrating.
