                    In addition to my research on Himalayan languages, I also have experience in coding and software development. In particular, I have experience in web development, working with JavaScript both client-side and server-side (Node.js), as well as with SQL and AWS architectures. My portfolio includes both personal and academic work, described below. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Academically, I have used my web development background to create tools for my research, such as the database summarising epistemic marking in Trans-Himalayan languages that developed out of my doctoral research, available <a href="database">here</a>. I have also been working on a fieldwork data glossing and analysis tool as a cross-platform alternative to FLEx, which will be available in early alpha before the end of 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My personal projects include tools to support large-scale in-person game events known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megagame">megagames</a>, including the interactive dashboard used by <a href="https://www.sydneymegagamers.com/">Sydney Megagamers</a> and <a href="https://www.melbournemegagames.com/">Melbourne Megagames</a> for their events, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duCQwTyy0Hc">First Contact 2024</a>.

                    <h2>Academic Projects</h2>
                    <h3>Fieldwork Data Tool</h3>
                    This project is a cross-platform tool for fieldwork data glossing and analysis, designed to be a lightweight alternative to FLEx. It is being built on the Electron framework, allowing it to run natively on all major operating systems.

                    <h3>HomeFile LAN File Transfer</h3>
                    This is a simple web-based file transfer tool for local area networks, allowing for easy transfer of files between devices on the same network without the data leaving said network using a Node.js as a peer server and the PeerJS library for the WebRTC protocol.

                    <h3>Megagame Dashboard</h3>
                    This is a web-based dashboard for megagames, allowing for various game-relevant information such as clocks, newsfeeds, and stats to be displayed to players and synchronised across multiple devices. It is built with a Node.js backend with a PostgreSQL database, and a Vanilla JavaScript frontend. It is used regularly by organisations running megagames in both Sydney and Melbourne.

                    <h3>Sydney Showdown</h3>
                    This web-app was developed to manage a Sydney-based adaptation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Lag:_The_Game#Season_13:_Schengen_Showdown"><i>Jet Lag the Game: Schengen Showdown</i> web series</a>. It uses a serverless Lambda-based architecture on AWS with a DynamoDB database to store game data, and a simple JavaScript frontend to allow players to interact with the game, "claiming" regions and viewing and completing challenges while travelling around Sydney's public transport network.
